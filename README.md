## How to play / Game mechanics
The goal of the game is to block the ball from leaving the square tube at your side,
and make the computer-controlled oponent unable to do so at his end.  
![UI explanation](images/UI_explanation.png)
The ball bounces of walls without changing speed, but will take up a percentage
of the velocity of the racket when it hits it.  
A new round is started when somebody misses, and the loser starts with the
ball attached to his racket.  
Move your racket with the mouse, and click to start the round when you have the ball.
Pause the game when the ball is in motion by clicking, click again to unpause.
